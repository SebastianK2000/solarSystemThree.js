# solarSystemThree.js

Link to the project: https://sebastiank2000.github.io/solarSystemThree.js/

## Description

A website that simulates the movement of planets in the solar system. No software or data entry is required just go to the project link and watch the simulation. The simulation is 3D so you can move around the project using the mouse, hold down the left mouse button and move the mouse. You can use the scrollbar to zoom in or out, while the right mouse button changes the position of the planets against the stars (changes the position of the entire simulation on the background).

The design is adaptable to any device.

I made the simulation using HTML5, JavaScript, Three.js, Vite, Git/GitHub pages.
